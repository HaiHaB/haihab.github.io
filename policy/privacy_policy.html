						<p>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

						<p>In Short: We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we
							have a valid legal reason (i.e. legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your
							consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfil our
							contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfil our legitimate business
							interests.</p>

						<p>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

						<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid
							legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely
							on the following legal bases to process your personal information: Consent. We may process
							your information if you have given us permission (i.e. consent) to use your personal
							information for a specific purpose. You can withdraw your consent at any time. Learn more
							about withdrawing your consent. Performance of a Contract. We may process your personal
							information when we believe it is necessary to fulfil our contractual obligations to you,
							including providing our Services or at your request prior to entering into a contract with
							you. Legitimate Interests. We may process your information when we believe it is reasonably
							necessary to achieve our legitimate business interests and those interests do not outweigh
							your interests and fundamental rights and freedoms. For example, we may process your
							personal information for some of the purposes described in order to: Send users information
							about special offers and discounts on our products and services Understand how our users use
							our products and services so we can improve user experience Legal Obligations. We may
							process your information where we believe it is necessary for compliance with our legal
							obligations, such as to cooperate with a law enforcement body or regulatory agency, exercise
							or defend our legal rights, or disclose your information as evidence in litigation in which
							we are involved. Vital Interests. We may process your information where we believe it is
							necessary to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of a third party, such as
							situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person. In legal terms, we are
							generally the 'data controller' under European data protection laws of the personal
							information described in this privacy notice, since we determine the means and/or purposes
							of the data processing we perform. This privacy notice does not apply to the personal
							information we process as a 'data processor' on behalf of our customers. In those
							situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a
							data processing agreement is the 'data controller' responsible for your personal
							information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your
							instructions. If you want to know more about our customers' privacy practices, you should
							read their privacy policies and direct any questions you have to them.</p>

						<p>If you are located in Canada, this section applies to you.</p>

						<p>We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e. express
							consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where
							your permission can be inferred (i.e. implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any
							time.</p>

						<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your
							information without your consent, including, for example: If collection is clearly in the
							interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way For investigations
							and fraud detection and prevention For business transactions provided certain conditions are
							met If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess,
							process, or settle an insurance claim For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and
							communicating with next of kin If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has
							been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse If it is reasonable to expect collection and
							use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and
							the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement
							or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province If disclosure is required to comply
							with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of
							records If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or
							profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was
							produced If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes If the
							information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</p>

						<p>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</p>

						<p>In Short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or
							with the following third parties.</p>

						<p>We may need to share your personal information in the following situations: Business
							Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during
							negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a
							portion of our business to another company.</p>

						<p>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

						<p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined
							in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

							set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
							law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
							require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which
							users have an account with us.</p>

						<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we
							will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example,
							because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely
							store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
							possible.</p>

						<p>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

						<p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and
							technical security measures.</p>

						<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures
							designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite
							our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
							Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
							promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will
							not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
							information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission
							of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
							the Services within a secure environment.</p>

						<p>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

							of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent&rsquo;s use of the Services. If we learn
							that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will
							deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our
							records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18,
							please contact us at support@brownsim.io.</p>

						<p>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

							Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal
							information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</p>

						<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data
							protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your
							personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
							processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In
							certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your
							personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact
							details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

							protection authority or UK data protection authority.</p>

							you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at
							any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU
							CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.</p>

						<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its
							withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal
							information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>

						<p>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our
							marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in
							the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section 'HOW

							lists. However, we may still communicate with you &mdash; for example, to send you
							service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account,
							to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>

						<p>Account Information</p>

						<p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or
							terminate your account, you can: Contact us using the contact information provided. Upon
							your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and

							terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>

						<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at
							support@brownsim.io.</p>

						<p>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>

						<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
							Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference
							not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this
							stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been
							finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
							mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
							standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform
							you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

						<p>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

						<p>In Short: Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding
							access to your personal information.</p>

							users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of
							charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third
							parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with

							on your behalf.</p>

						<p>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</p>

						<p>We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written
							contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity
							that processes the information on our behalf, following the same strict privacy protection
							obligations mandated by the CCPA.</p>

						<p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking
							internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to

						<p>We have not disclosed, sold, or shared any personal information to third parties for a
							business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. We will not sell or
							share personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other
							consumers.</p>

						<p>Right to request deletion of the data &mdash; Request to delete</p>

						<p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your
							personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information,
							subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by
							another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting
							from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal
							activities.</p>

						<p>Right to be informed &mdash; Request to know</p>

						<p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know: whether we collect and use your
							personal information; the categories of personal information that we collect; the purposes
							for which the collected personal information is used; whether we sell or share personal
							information to third parties; the categories of personal information that we sold, shared,
							or disclosed for a business purpose; the categories of third parties to whom the personal
							information was sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose; the business or
							commercial purpose for collecting, selling, or sharing personal information; and the

							de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify
							a consumer request.</p>

						<p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer&rsquo;s Privacy Rights</p>

						<p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

						<p>Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information</p>

						<p>We do not process consumer's sensitive personal information.</p>

						<p>Verification process</p>

						<p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the
							same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts
							require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you
							have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we
							may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide
							with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication
							method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other
							verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>

						<p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or
							authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional
							information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your
							identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide
							additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or
							fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as
							we finish verifying you.</p>

						<p>Other privacy rights You may object to the processing of your personal information. You may
							request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to
							restrict the processing of the information. You can designate an authorised agent to make a
							request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorised agent that
							does not submit proof that they have been validly authorised to act on your behalf in
							accordance with the CCPA. You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your
							personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon
							the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date
							of the request submission. To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at
							support@brownsim.io, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.
							If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.</p>
